### Module 2
Created a simple To-Do list. Allows you to add/edit/remove/view multiple lists. Saves data in a serialized file (todo.ser).

All methods have JavaDoc comments and Items/Lists are objects that can be implemented in other code. The TDResult class is never used (implemented at the beginning but wasn't needed) but seems useful for features for other projects in the future.
